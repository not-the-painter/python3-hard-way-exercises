# use input() to prompt a user for input

print("How old are you?", end=' ')

height = input()
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')

print(f"So, you're {age} years old, You're {height} tall and you weigh {weight} lbs.")



# example: a simple script that asks the user for two numbers and returns their sum

a = int(input("What is the first number? "))
b = int(input("What is the second number? "))

c =  a + b

print(f"{a} + {b} = {c}")
